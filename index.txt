specsonly.com is an 80-column plaintext website that contains specifications for
various things people are interesterd in. it started when I wanted to track the
release date and specs for the Google Pixel 5.

the idea is to have a simple website that only contains the data, but none of
the commentary, speculation, or long-winded blog posts that keep you from just
seeing what's up.
